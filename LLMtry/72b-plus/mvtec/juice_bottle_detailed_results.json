This change in the fruit icon is a logical anomaly because it suggests that the contents of the juice have changed from orange to banana, which is not indicated by the text \"100% Juice\" but rather by the visual representation on the label.\n\nThere are no structural anomalies visible in either image. Both bottles appear to be intact and without any damage or deformation. The liquid inside both bottles looks consistent in color and level, suggesting no structural issues.\n\nThe only difference between the two images is the icon on the label, which changes from an orange to a banana.

In the first image, the label features an orange icon with a simple outline, while in the second image, the label has a more complex design with a filled-in circle within a square. This change in design could be considered a logical anomaly because it alters the visual representation of the product's content (orange juice). The structural integrity and appearance of the bottle itself remain consistent between the two images, with no visible damage or deformation.\n\nThe coordinates for the label area are as follows:\n- First image: {'bbox_2d': [105, 204, 236, 318], 'label': 'logical_anomalies'}\n- Second image: {'bbox_2d': [191, 742, 455, 1007], 'label': 'logical_anomalies'}\n\nSince the label design has changed, this indicates a logical anomaly in the second image compared to the first image.",

However, there is a noticeable foreign object in the second image, which appears as a small blue speck near the bottom right side of the bottle. This speck is not present in the first image and does not match the expected composition of a juice product.\n\nThe presence of this foreign object introduces a structural anomaly because it represents an unexpected and potentially harmful element that could affect the quality or safety of the product. It is not part of the intended contents and could indicate contamination during production or storage.\n\nNo other structural anomalies are apparent between the two images, as both bottles appear to have the same structure and labeling. The logical consistency between the label and the liquid's appearance is maintained in both images, so no logical anomalies are identified.\n\nGiven the clear evidence of a foreign object in the second image, the answer is:",
