The only difference is the color of the peach in the second image, which appears to have a more greenish hue compared to the first image where the peach has a reddish hue.\n\nThe logical anomaly here is the change in the color of the peach. While this might not be a significant defect, it could indicate a change in the ripeness or possibly a different variety of peach. However, since the question specifies that we should identify defects strictly based on the given list ('logical_anomalies', 'structural_anomalies'), and the change in color does not necessarily imply a structural issue, we can consider this a logical anomaly.\n\nThe coordinates for the peach in the second image are approximately [156, 230, 478, 900]. The label for this anomaly would be 'logical_anomalies'.",
